I'm a computer science student at the University of Illinois Chicago with a concentration in Software Engineering. I'm most interested in understanding the creation and implemenation of operating systems as well as game development. At the moment I'm most comitted to mastering JAVA to it's fullest, as well as currently trying to learn x86 assembly.
